# Working with Document Conversion

Essential DocIO provides a support to convert documents from one format to another format. Each file format document can be categorized as flow layout document or fixed layout document. 

**Flow layout document:**

* A flow document is designed to "reflow content" depending on application.
* Doesnâ€™t contain any information about the position of its content.
* Dynamically render the content by application at run time.
* Example: DOC, DOCX, HTML, EPUB, RTF and TEXT file formats.

* Maintains the fixed position for each content.
