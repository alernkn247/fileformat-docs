application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Excel2013;

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(1);

IWorksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//Adding a picture

IPictureShape shape = worksheet.Pictures.AddPicture(1, 1, "Image.png");

workbook.SaveAs("AddingImage.xlsx");

workbook.Close();

excelEngine.Dispose();



{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb %}
Dim excelEngine As New ExcelEngine()

Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel

application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Excel2013

Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Create(1)

Dim worksheet As IWorksheet = workbook.Worksheets(0)

'Adding a picture 

Dim shape As IPictureShape = worksheet.Pictures.AddPicture(1, 1, "Image.png")

IPictureShape shape = worksheet.Pictures.AddPicture(1, 1, "Image.png");

//Positioning a Picture

shape.Top = 100;

shape.Left = 100;
